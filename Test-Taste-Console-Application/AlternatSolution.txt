Another solution that came up to me was following:
Instead of adding calculating the average of all the moon gravities while fetching the moon inforamtion in PlanetService.cs, it can be done in ScreenOutputService.cs file by running a loop through planet.moons and calculating the average just before displaying. I abandoned this idea due to following two reasons:
	1. Since the class name is ScreenOutputService.cs it should only bear the responsibility of producing screen output and not any other process will violate the Single Responsibility Principle.
	2. This method will add an extra loop iteration which will cost time. Since a loop is already running, it is best to move this process of calculating the Average Moon Gravity there itself.
